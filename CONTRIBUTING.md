Thanks for wanting to help to improve this for other poeple! I am so sorry that you encountered a issue! I will try to fix it ASAP!

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or the scoring seems off, open an issue with:
- What site you were on (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc)
- What happened vs what you expected
- Screenshot if possible

## False Positives

If a legit job is getting flagged, let me know:
- What kind of job it was
- What score it got
- What reasons were shown

This helps me tune the algorithm.

## Suggesting Features

Open an issue describing what you want and why it'd be useful.

## Code Contributions

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Test on a few different job sites
4. Submit a PR

Keep the code style similar to what's already there.

## Known Red Flags We Could Add

If you've noticed patterns that indicate ghost jobs, share them! Things like:
- Specific phrases companies use
- Company behaviors (reposting patterns, etc)
- Platform-specific indicators

## Questions

Open an issue with the question label.

Thanks!
